## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `python_files` directory:

   ```bash
   cd python_files
   ```

2. Make the server script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run_server.sh
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   ./run_server.sh
   ```

Make sure Python and required dependencies are installed. The server will handle input from your phone and convert it to virtual gamepad signals using `vgamepad`.
